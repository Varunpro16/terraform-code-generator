Generate Terraform code to create an AWS EC2 instance with default settings.

Elastic IP association and creation.
A TLS private key generation and saving it to a local file.
Creation of an AWS Key Pair using the generated TLS private key.
Security Group configuration to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic.
EC2 Instance setup with the specified AMI, instance type, and security group.
Volume configuration (EBS) for the EC2 instance with specific size and type (gp3).
User data script to change the SSH port from 22 to 4545.
Output sensitive details such as the private key content and public key.
Variables for region, subnet, VPC, instance details, and security group name.
Subnet ID and availability zone filters for the subnet."
Make sure to structure the code with the following specifications:

Use aws_eip_association to associate the elastic IP.
Use aws_eip to create an Elastic IP.
Use tls_private_key for generating the private key.
Use aws_key_pair for creating the key pair.
Use aws_security_group for the security group setup.
Use aws_instance for EC2 instance creation with a user-data script that modifies SSH configuration.
When referencing a security group for the EC2 instance, use the `vpc_security_group_ids` attribute and provide the security group ID, not the name. 
Do not use the `security_groups` attribute with the name of the security group.

Ensure the private key is saved to a local file with restricted permissions.
Include output blocks for the private key and public key.
Give different names for the aws resources involved in this project
Use appropriate variables for region, instance type, subnet ID, VPC ID, and other parameters."
